# code-refactor homework
I went in and cleaned up lines of the code adding different semantic tags to clarify as well as adding description tags to let other devs know what I was doing. I also fixed the broken link for the Search Engine Optimization tab in the nav bar.

I went through the CSS file and consolidated some redundant lines to make it easier to read. I also added descriptions of what each class is intended to do, again for it to be easily edited by another dev.
